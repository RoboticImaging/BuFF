# BuFF: Burst Feature Finder for Light-Constrained 3D Reconstruction

We introduce burst feature finder (BuFF), **a 2D + time feature detector and descriptor that finds features with well defined scale and apparent motion within a burst of frames**. We reformulate the trajectory of a robot as multiple burst sequences and perform **3D reconstruction in low light**.
